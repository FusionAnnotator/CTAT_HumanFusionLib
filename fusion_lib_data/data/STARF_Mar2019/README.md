These are results from running STAR-Fusion v1.5 using CTAT genome lib: GRCh38_v27_CTAT_lib_Feb092018
on CCLE, GTEx, and TCGA.  Computes were performed in late 2018.

TCGA and CCLE leveraged defaults.

GTEx included the --no_annotation_filter to prevent discarding fusions based on earlier GTEx results.
